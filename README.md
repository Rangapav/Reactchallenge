Mini Slot Booking System using Reactjs Framework,Javascript and web technologies using HTML and CSS

This Slot booking system is made with 3 components having SlotBooking.js,Room.js,TimeSlot.js..

App.js: The main component of the application. It displays a welcome message and renders the SlotBooking component.

SlotBooking.js: This component represents the slot booking section. It renders six room components from Monday-saturday, each with a unique name. Users can book slots in these rooms.

Room.js: For each room, this component displays a list of available time slots. Users can click on a slot to book it (in green) or cancel a booked slot (in blue if selected). Only one slot can be booked at a time.

TimeSlot.js: Represents individual time slots. It handles slot booking and cancellation. Clicking on a slot books it if available (green), cancels it if booked (blue), or alerts the user if the slot is already booked (red).

App.css : These CSS files provide basic styling for the application, including room cards, time slots, and buttons. Green slots are available, red slots are already booked, and blue slots are selected for booking or cancellation.












# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
